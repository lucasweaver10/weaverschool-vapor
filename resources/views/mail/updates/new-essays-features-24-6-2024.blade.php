# New features for Essay Grader

I have good news and bad news. 

The bad news is that the Essay Grader just got **5X more expensive**... _for me to operate_.  

The good news is that it has **4 new features** and is **still the same price for you!**

## What are the new features?

### 1. Sentence Structure Analysis
- Now with each essay you'll get an in-depth breakdown of the types of sentences that you used.

- This incldudes a comparison to a benchmark for the target percentage you need for the essay score you want.

- It will also give you suggestions on how to improve your sentence structure.

### 2. Vocabulary Analyis
- Now get an in-depth breakdown of the words you used by the CEFR level that they are (i.e. B2, C1, etc...)

- You'll see the percentage of words that are at each level and a comparison to the benchmark for the essay score you want.

![transition analysis](https://we-public.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/images/emails/transition+analysis.jpg)
### 3. Transitions Analysis
- Now get an in-depth breakdown of the transitions that you used in your essay based on the CEFR level of each one.

- Again, you'll see a percentage breakdown of these, and get improvements for better transitions you can use on your essays.

![argument analysis](https://we-public.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/images/emails/argument+analysis.jpg)
### 4. Argument Relevance Analysis
- The last new feature is an analysis of the argument you made in your essay. You'll get a breakdown of the relevance of each argument to your thesis statement
 and how well your supporting points stayed related to the topic throughout your essay.

## How can you get access to these new features?

If you're a susbscriber already, you don't need to do anything different. Just submit your essays like normal and you'll see 4 new tabs that contain the new analysis sections.

Each new piece of analysis is processed separately, so you may need to refresh the page if you don't see the feedback in the tab you choose.

If you're not a subscriber yet, you can get access to these new features by getting at least a <a href="https://weaverschool.com/subscription-checkout/basic/3001" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Weaver School Basic</a> subscription.

## What else is new?

There are now **7 total IELTS Speaking Practice Tests** to choose from, and **6 for the Cambridge Exams**.

Weaver School Pro users can submit 5 each month, and all users can submit 1 to try it out. If you haven't tried it yet, give it a shot.

If you have any questions just reply to this email and I'll be happy to help!
