Hey there,

You haven't registered for my <em>Master IELTS Writing</em> course yet, so I wanted to give you a helpful nudge in that direction.

The course has been so helpful for so many students over the years, and I know it will help you too.

So to make sure you don't miss out on this opportunity, <strong>I want to give you a FREE bonus registration</strong> to my
<em>Mastering English Word Order</em> course, if you sign up today.

<img style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px;" src="https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/1718107418-425194ce1584991bf3c92c80d5a5ec367cab8b2fab081675d224423058a0a85f-d_295x166?r=pad">

As you'll see once you get access to the course, I mention that word order is one of the most important things you need to know
 to sound natural when writing and speaking in English.

So naturally, improving this area will also help you in your Speaking and Writing sections of your IELTS exam.

This course is usually $19 if you buy it alone. But if you sign up for your <em>Master IELTS Writing</em> course in the <strong>next 24 hours</strong>,
you'll get this extra course <em>completely free</em>. And you'll keep access to both courses for life.

And of course, you can still try the course for FREE for 7 days to make sure you find it valuable before you pay.

P.S. <strong><em>I never offer discounts on my courses.</em></strong> I work very hard to create all of them, and I know they're worth more than the price I charge.
So there won't be any "50% off discounts" or anything like that coming in a later email.

If you have any questions, just reply back to this email and I'll be happy to help you out in any way I can.

<br>
Take care and talk soon,<br>
Lucas Weaver
