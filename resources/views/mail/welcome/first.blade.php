Hey there, I'm Lucas Weaver, founder (*and only employee*) of the Weaver School.

<br>I want to personally **welcome you to this platform** and make sure you get everything you need to accomplish your language learning goals.

This is my direct email, so anytime you have a problem, **please email me here**.

I check my email pretty much all day, so the only time I won't respond is usually when I'm asleep.  

<br>My goal with the tools I build here are simple: **help you become fluent in your target language faster using the power of AI**.

AI is everywhere these days, and it's also in a lot of places it probably shouldn't.

<br>But here at the Weaver School, my goal is to enhance your language learning experience using AI.

That means **taking processes that used to take a lot of time**, or that used to be very expensive, and **using AI to automate them for you, saving your time and energy**.

<br>For example, in the past if you wanted to create a set of 40 flashcards about the topic of "ordering coffee in Vietnamese", you would spend hours on this process. 

- Listing all the words
- Finding the translations
- Finding images
- Adding them to the flashcards
- Finding audio examples
- Adding those to the flashcards

<br>But now, you can do all of that in a matter of minutes using my [AI flashcard maker](https://weaverschool.com/en/flashcards)

Or how about in the past when you used to need to pay for expensive courses that would give you the vocabulary words and explanations you needed to start learning a language?

Now with my [Learning Paths](https://weaverschool.com/en/learning-paths) product, you can get a fully personalized learning path for any topic you choose, and start making progress speaking your target language in minutes.

These are just two examples of the ways you can use AI to enhance your language learning with the Weaver School.

<br>Is there something else you need help with in your language learning journey?

Reply back to this email and I'll be happy to see what I can do.

<br>Thanks again for joining here, and I look forward to helping you in the future. 

<br>
Take care and talk soon,<br>
