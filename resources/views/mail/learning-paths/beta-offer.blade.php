# Learning Paths Beta Program Details

Thanks for your interest in beta testing my new Learning Paths product!

Here are the steps to **get early access and 50% off** for one year (billed monthly): 

Sign up for a free Weaver School account [here](https://weaverschool.com/register).

After you've created your account, you can then visit this subscription [link](https://weaverschool.com/trial-subscription-checkout/premium/7001).

Enter the coupon code: **BETA2024** and you'll get 50% taken off your bill each month for the next 12 months.

You'll get 7 days to try it out before your card is charged, you can cancel anytime before then.

**Why is the product in 'Beta'?**

The Learning Paths launch version is complete and fully functional. However, as with any product, I'm certain there will be a few bugs here and there.

That's why I'm letting a small group of users get early access at a discounted price to help me find and fix any issues before the full launch.

Thank you for your help. And please let me know if you have any questions!
