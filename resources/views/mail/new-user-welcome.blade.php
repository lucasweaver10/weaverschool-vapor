# <div align="center">Welcome to The Weaver School, let's get you started</div>

Hey there, I’m Lucas, the founder, course designer, web designer, customer support, and basically everything at the Weaver School.

I wanted to send a quick note to personally thank you for signing up for your account. My goal is to help you **achieve fluency in your target language as quickly as possible**. 

You have a busy schedule, I know, so I’ve designed these courses based on the **most proven language-learning neuroscience** to help you improve as much as possible with each lesson.

But let me be clear right now though, **you will have to invest some time into your course**. 

I’ve learned Spanish while living in Spain, Dutch in the Netherlands, Korean in South Korea, and now I’m traveling long-term in Southeast Asia learning a bit of each new language as I go.

Let me tell you what I’ve learned through my language-learning journey and teaching English to over 300 students from all over the world: 

**You have to do the homework if you want to improve quickly**.

Learning a new language as an adult is not easy. That’s why in your course you’ll have required homework every week.

However, I’ve made sure that your homework is **extremely relevant to you and easy to understand**, with no “cookie-cutter” worksheets created back in 2003.

_(Cookie cutter: the same approach or style is always used and not enough attention is paid to individual differences._

_Example: I was really disappointed with how **cookie cutter** their proposal was. I was hoping for something a bit more tailored to our brand.)_

You’ll get clear instructions in the “Guided Practice” section that will help you understand how to complete the “Free Practice” section. And then once you submit your homework, **you can see explanations for the questions you got wrong**.

You’ll also get a new set of flashcards each week ready to use in Quizlet, so you can **easily study your new vocabulary words** whenever and wherever you want.

Oh right, and speaking practice. I thought you’d ask about that…

**100% of the time you spend with your teachers will be used on speaking practice.**

That’s the beauty of using our hybrid learning model. Watch my video lessons first, then **use your lesson time to actually practice speaking** your target language.

To get started, all you need to do is [register](https://www.weaverschool.com/en/dashboard/registrations/create) for one of our courses. 

You'll be able to take advantage of our expert instructors, engaging homework, and start getting closer to the fluency you want. 

It's a pleasure to have you here, and I’m looking forward to helping you achieve your language learning goals.
