# Welcome to the Weaver School Newsletter

Welcome to the Weaver School Newsletter.

I'm Lucas Weaver, the founder _(and currently only employee)_ of the Weaver School, and every month I'll be 
sending you an email with my tips and thoughts on language learning that I hope will help you on your personal language learning journey.

One thing you can do to help me give you the best newsletter each month is this:

**Please reply to this email telling me what you hope to get out of this newsletter**. 

And if you have time, feel free to tell me more like: What are your langauge learning goals, which language you're learning, and anything else you feel like telling me. I'm always happy to chat with other language learners.

Until then I want to offer you **a special thank you** for subscribing to the newsletter. I've just released a new product called _"Learning Paths"_ that helps you learn how to speak about any topic in your target language in just two weeks.

I'm offering you a 50% discount on your first year of Learning Paths. All you have to do is follow these two steps:

1. Sign up for a free Weaver School account [here](https://weaverschool.com/register).

2. After you've created your account, visit this subscription [link](https://weaverschool.com/trial-subscription-checkout/premium/7001).

You'll get 7 days to try it out before your card is charged and you can cancel anytime before then.

Thanks again for subscribing to the newsletter. I'm looking forward to hearing from you!
