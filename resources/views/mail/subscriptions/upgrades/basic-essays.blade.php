# Only interested in essays?

Hey there, I'm sending you this email because you're out of trial essay submissions, and you haven't upgraded to a Weaver School Pro account.

If you're interested in **only having your essays checked**, you can also subscribe to a **Weaver School Basic** account.

This will still let you **submit 10 essays each month** to be checked and scored by AI, but you won't get access to any Speaking Practice Tests, or any of the other AI features on the site.

The cost for Weaver School Basic is just **$4.99/mo**.

If you want this option, just [click here to sign up](https://weaverschool.com/subscription-checkout/basic/1001).


<br>Good luck with your essays!
