        But I find it hard to know where I have to improve to actually get a 7. Can you help me?" - <em>email from Pieter de Jong, The Netherlands</em>
    </div>
    <div class="xl:mx-36 text-2xl mt-12 prose prose-xl">
        <p class="text-4xl mb-2 font-bold">Dear IELTS taker,</p>
        <p>Do you want to score a 7 or above on the writing section of your IELTS exam <strong>the first time you take it?</strong></p>
        <p class="mt-4">Here's the secret:</p>
        <div class="text-4xl font-bold text-center">
            No more private tutors, no more way too expensive in-person courses, no more long IELTS textbooks. Just a simple online video
            course that teaches you an <em>easy academic writing framework</em> that WORKS.
        </div>
        <p>Here's the story: I started my language school on <strong>February 17th 2018</strong> in Rotterdam (the Netherlands).</p>
        <p>At the time that I'm writing this, that was over 5 years ago...</p>
        <p>In that time, I've helped over <strong>300 people</strong> pass their IELTS exams. And more people continue to ask me for help
         every week.</p>
        <p>The fact is, my online IELTS writing course is one of the best mixes of helpful information
         and affordability that you can find anywhere on the internet.</p>
        <p>Most importantly: it helps you <strong>earn a 7 or above</strong> on your IELTS essays.</p>
        <p>Within the first 30 days of starting my language school back in 2018, I helped <strong><em>15 students pass their IELTS exams.</em></strong></p>
        <p>And that email from Pieter that I showed you the snippet from above? That was from <em><strong>just last month.</strong></em></p>
        <p>That's over <strong>60 people <em>per year</em></strong> that I've helped to get the scores they need on their IELTS exams so they
        can do things like: <strong>emigrate to a new country, start a new university program, or get a new job.</strong></p>
        <p>This is Seyma, my student from Turkey who I helped pass her IELTS exam so she could get a Master's Degree. (Yes I know the beard was terrible :| )</p>
        <div>
            <img alt="" class="h-80 mx-auto" src="/images/pages/ielts/lucas and seyma ielts course.jpg">
        </div>
        <p>You know what the best part was?</p>
        <p>Seyma wasn't great at English. She was above average, and she was super smart. But <em><strong>she just wasn't prepared for the
        IELTS exam</strong></em> because she was so unfamiliar with it.</p>
        <p>This was really hurting her confidence. But after working with me, and learning this super simple academic essay framework
         that I teach in my IELTS writing course...</p>
        <p>She knocked her exam out of the park!</p>
        <p>She got a 7.5 on her essay and <strong>she didn't even have to improve her English</strong> one little bit.</p>
        <p>The good news is, <strong><em>the same story can be yours.</em></strong></p>
        <p><strong>You can get the score you need</strong> on the writing section of your IELTS exam. Whether it's a 6.5, a 7, or <strong>even a 7.5</strong>.</p>
        <p>It's much easier than you think.</p>

        <p>But first, let me explain just how I came to learn <strong>how truly effective this academic essay writing framework is</strong> for IELTS students.</p>
        <p>I started teaching IELTS students in Seville, Spain back in 2016.</p>
        <p>At that time I was brand new to English teaching, and brand new to IELTS.</p>
        <p>I had never even <em>heard</em> of the IELTS exam!</p>
        <p>But once I started helping students prepare for the exam, I noticed <strong>all they were really missing was all the academic
         writing skills I had been taught</strong> in high school and university back in the States.</p>
        <p>But most of the students I was teaching <strong>had never been taught high-level academic writing</strong>.</p>
        <p>They didn't know about <u>thesis statements</u>, or about how to <u>make and support different arguments</u> using key points and relevant examples.</p>
        <p>Most students only knew how to write down their thoughts and ideas, but it became much more difficult for them to do it in English.</p>
        <p>I hadn't known these students very long. But I <em>cared</em> about them, and I <strong>wanted them to pass this exam</strong>.</p>
        <p>And I wanted them to pass it on their first try, especially since they told me it was <strong><em>over €300</em></strong> just to register!</p>
        <p>So that's when I started working on a way to simplify and explain the most effective <strong>academic essay writing frameworks</strong> so my students
        could understand and use them.</p>
        <div class="text-4xl text-center font-bold xl:mx-24">
            That's when I started to figure it all out and everything changed...
        </div>
        <p>I went back and found all of my notes I still had from uni, and then I went and researched all the old techniques I had been taught by my teachers.</p>
        <p>Then I combined everything and reduced it down to enough content to fit it into a <strong>short course that would teach any IELTS taker
         everything they need to know to get a <u>7 or above</u></strong> on the writing section of their IELTS exam.</p>
        <p class="text-3xl"><strong>AND IT WORKED!</strong></p>
        <p>Student after student of mine passed their IELTS exam and then came back to me thanking me for the academic essay framework,
         telling me just how much it helped them <strong>write the essays faster, easier, and of course get the score they needed</strong>.</p>
        <p>The next year I moved to the Netherlands and continued teaching IELTS courses. I taught students from all over the world, from South Korea to Turkey to France to Brazil.</p>
        <p>The more students I taught, the more <strong>I continued to improve the content</strong> of the lessons and help students learn the techniques.</p>
        <p>So of course when I decided to open my own language school in the Netherlands, <strong>the first course I offered was an IELTS prep course</strong>.</p>
        <p>I gave one-day IELTS prep workshops, 10-week in-person group courses, and tons of private 1-on-1 lessons.</p>
        <div class="text-center">
            <img class="h-80 mx-auto" alt="" src="/images/pages/ielts/ielts group workshop photo with lucas.jpg">
        </div>
        <p>From 2016 in Spain up to now, <strong>I've helped over 300 students pass their IELTS exams.</strong></p>
        <p>Now that I've put all of my lesson content into this <strong>super easy to follow video course</strong> that
            people can take from anywhere, I hope to get that number into the thousands!</p>
        <p>I get it, you don't know me, so you're not sure if I can actually how to teach you how to get a 7 or above on your essays.</p>
        <p>That's totally fair. But the best part for you is, you're not the first person who has tried it.</p>
        <p>I'm so lucky that so many students have worked with me in the past and let me share their experiences...</p>
        <div class="text-4xl text-center font-bold xl:mx-24">
            This is Lisette... she's from the Netherlands and found me on Facebook. She got a 7.5 on her IELTS exam writing section!
        </div>
        <div class="text-center">
            <img class="h-80 mx-auto" alt="" src="/images/pages/ielts/lucas and lisette ielts celebration.jpg">
        </div>
        <p>This was us celebrating the day she got the results. She was able to do a Master's Degree in English after that.</p>
        <p>And this next photo was <strong>Anna, from Pakistan.</strong> She needed to pass her IELTS exam to stay in the Netherlands and study there.</p>
        <p>No pressure, right?!</p>
        <div class="text-center">
            <img class="h-80 mx-auto" alt="" src="/images/pages/ielts/lucas and anna ielts course.jpg">
        </div>
        <p><strong>She passed with a 7</strong> and was able to stay in the Netherlands and attend university. Her mom even gave me a hug :).</p>
        <p>And this lovely fellow here is Osama. He had just arrived from Syria as a refugee and was <strong>hoping to get into a pre-Master's</strong> program
        that required at least a 6.</p>
        <div class="text-center">
            <img class="h-80 mx-auto" alt="" src="/images/pages/ielts/osama ielts course weaver school.jpg">
        </div>
        <p><strong>It was a real struggle for him</strong>, and he worked super hard, but luckily in the end <strong>he got a 6 and was thrilled!</strong></p>
