                <p class="mt-3 text-xl sm:mt-4">
                    If you're serious about improving your English, we're here to help. As a purely online English school, we've used the <strong>neuroscience behind adult learning</strong> to design our courses specially for 
                    adult online students. <strong>You will get everything you need in a guided, step-by-step program</strong> that will help you advance your English language skills 
                    in all the core components of speaking and using English.

                <p class="mt-3 text-xl sm:mt-4">
                    The methods we use to improve your English language skills as an adult are not rocket science, but they are based on neuroscience. Put simply, you need to do certain activities to learn a language 
                    as an adult, and in our <a href="/{{ session('locale') }}/english/courses/online">online English courses</a>, we make sure that you perform these activities in a <strong>simple and easy to understand way</strong> that will help you make progress each lesson.

                <p class="mt-3 text-xl sm:mt-4">
                    You will watch <strong>one video lesson each week</strong> that contains grammar and vocabulary instruction and explanation. This will help you understand the language concepts you need 
                    to know at a high level before you do your homework exercises for that week.

                <p class="mt-3 text-xl sm:mt-4">
                    Once you finish a video lesson, the concepts will still be fairly new to you, and you won't understand everything completely. That's why the first homework exercise you'll do 
                    each week is an online exercise called a <strong>"Guided Practice" that walks you through each exercise question while further explaining the concepts</strong> from the video lesson. This will 
                    help you to learn the new concepts more completely and feel more confident before you start the more advanced homework.

                <p class="mt-3 text-xl sm:mt-4">
                    After you've completed the Guided Practice, now it's time to do your Free Practice exercise. This exercise tests your knowledge of the video lesson material and your skills in 
                    using the new English skills you've learned. You will do this <strong>20-question exercise on your own with no help or explanation</strong>. However, after you submit your answers, <strong>you will get a score and 
                    see the reasons behind the answers you got wrong</strong>. This will help you further learn the material.

                <p class="mt-3 text-xl sm:mt-4">
                    After you've completed the other exercises, you will take a quiz that tests your knowledge of all the material from that lesson. This quiz is similar to the Free Practice, but the questions 
                    are a bit more difficult, and <strong>the grade is weighted more heavily</strong> in your overall lesson grade. 
                </p>
                <p class="mt-3 text-xl sm:mt-4">
                    The questions are also presented one by one, and after each question you will either get a 
                    positive or negative visual and audio response. There are also random bonus questions throughout quizzes that allow you to earn extra points. All of these components are helpful in <strong>activating the 
                    neural circuits necessary to achieve nueroplasticity</strong> and initiating the process of learning and remembering the material.

                <p class="mt-3 text-xl sm:mt-4">
                    Every week you'll be given <strong>15 new vocabulary words to learn, with digital flash cards included</strong> for each word. All of the homework exercises for that lesson will 
                    also include those words in a real-world context to help you further learn and memorize them.

                <p class="mt-3 text-xl sm:mt-4">
                    Now it's time to put all of that time doing homework to good use. The beauty of doing your grammar lesson as a pre-recorded video lesson is that you get to spend 100% of your time each week with your 
                    teacher practicing your speaking skills. <strong>Each week you will have a one-hour speaking lesson with a certified, native-English speaking teacher</strong> where you will be asked discussion questions that force you to use the vocabulary 
                    words you've been studying, as well as the grammar concepts you've learned that week. 
                </p>
                <p class="mt-3 text-xl sm:mt-4">
                    <strong>Your teacher will proactively correct your mistakes during the lesson, providing the necessary neural feedback to your brain</strong> to improve in the areas 
                    where you still struggle.

                <p class="mt-3 text-xl sm:mt-4">
                    <strong>In total, you will complete a 12-week course</strong> with 12, or 24 speaking lessons, depending on if you do the Standard or Intensive option. This will result in <strong>you being at least one entire CEFR level higher 
                    in English</strong> than you were before you started your course. You will have <strong>mastered at least 150 new vocabulary words</strong>, as well as all the tenses and grammar concepts you need to know to speak English at a high level.

                <p class="mt-3 text-xl sm:mt-4">
                    <strong>If speaking fluent English is your goal, our courses will help you do it.</strong> After learning all of the course material and spending 12 hours speaking English with a certified native-speaking teacher, your comfort 
                    level and confidence speaking English will be high enough to <strong>speak English without stopping in almost any situation you need.</strong> You'll feel like you have an entire new weapon in your life to use in any situation 
                    where the need for English comes up.

                <p class="mt-3 text-xl sm:mt-4">
                    This may seem like a difficult decision at first, but it can actually be quite simple. If you need English primarily for high-level international business situations, with heavy use of business-focused vocabulary, 
                    the Advanced Business English course is best for you. If you don't need a heavy business focus, the general courses are a better option for you. If you need to improve your English as fast as possible and 
                    have at least 5 hours each week to dedicate to your lessons, the Intensive option is right for you. If not, the Standard option will be enough to help you reach your goals.
