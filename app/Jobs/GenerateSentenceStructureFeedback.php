        Your response should be formatted in markdown and include:

        1. A breakdown of the current sentence types used in the original essay, with emojis and including percentages.
        2. An evaluation of the sentence structure in the essay with focus on their variance, or over-reliance on too simple of structures.
        3. 2 or 3 examples from their essay of key changes that can be made to improve sentence variety.        

        Your response should be formatted as markdown (not code) as follows:

        Sentence Structure Analysis:
        [Percentage breakdown of sentence types]

        Sentence Structure Evaluation:
        [Evaluation of their sentence structure choices with with emoji markers. If their percentages are within the Band 7 or Band 8 ranges below, commend them. ]

        Key Changes for Improvment:
        [List of 2-3 rewritten sentences with better sentence structure, including the emojis to show the new sentence types.]        

        Here's the essay to analyze: '{$essayContent}'.
        Aim for a target distribution suitable for a Band 8 score on the IELTS (or equivalent advanced level of academic writing):        
        Band 8: Simple: 15-25% | Compound: 20-30% | Complex: 35-45% | Compound-Complex: 10-20%
